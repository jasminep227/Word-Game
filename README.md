# Word-Game

Description: This project is made to give the user a similar experience to the classic board game “Mastermind”. The program uses a random number generator to choose the index of a word from an array list of strings, scans the user input, and uses custom functions to tell the user how accurate their guess is.  This game was created on the Replit online integrated development environment using Python language for a Python class (Introduction to Higher Education Comp Sci). 

Running the code: If you would like to run this project, copy this code into Replit. First, create a main Python file to add the GameMain code. Then create another Python file to create the ‘world’ and copy the Draw file code. Then simply click the ‘Run’ button and begin guessing!
